# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a
Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/), and this project
adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html)
(or at least intends to).

## Unreleased

- Respect `Connection: keep-alive` in responses. (Don't close the
  connection.)
- Respect `Set-Cookie` in responses. Currently, it is entirely ignored
  (!). Simple approach: accept all cookies. More complicated options
  can be imagined:
	  - Permit an option for disallowing all cookies (command line?
        parameter?) `%cookies = false`, `%cookies = true`
	  - Add notation for removing a cookie from the cookie jar (won't
        be included in any future requests). Perhaps: `remove
        ^Cookies[session]`.
	  - Add notation for setting a cookie `^Cookies[foo] := "whatever"`
	  - Add notation for adding a cookie for a single request,
        analogous to the way we can add a header to a single
        request. Something like: `GET /foo with cookies { "session":
        "no" } responds with 2XX`, `GET /foo with additional cookies {
        "session": "whatever" } responds with 2XX` and `GET /foo
        without cookie "session" responds with 2XX`.

## [0.8.2] - 2018-11-20

### Added

- Better error reporting when a JSON Pointer error occurs.

## [0.8.1] - 2018-11-20

### Added

- Better error reporting when responses do not adhere to a JSON
  Schema.

## [0.8.0] - 2018-11-19

### Added

- When called with --lint, Riposte now parses its argument and reports
  whether it is well-formed. (And does no further work.)

### Fixed

- Executing Riposte with a Riposte file in the current working
  directory now works.

## [0.7.0] - 2018-11-16

### Added

- Support "XXX" as an HTTP response code pattern.
- New command, `exec`, for executing an arbitrary program. Useful for
  doing test setup & teardown.

### Fixed

- Support commands with a payload but without response code check
  (e.g., `POST $foo /whatever`).

## [0.6.0] - 2018-11-14

### Added

- New echo command for echoing the value of a variable or response
  header. There are three variants:
	  + `echo` (no arguments) will echo the body of the previously
        received HTTP response;
	  + `echo $foo` will echo the value of `$foo`
	  + `echo ^Location` will echo the value of the `Location`
        response header.
- `exists` can now be combined with relative JSON Pointers. This now
  works: `/hi exists relative to $foo`.

## [0.5.0]

### Added

- Response code patterns can use a little x as well as a big X.

## [0.4.2]

### Added

- A little program to print our own dependencies (`dependencies.rkt`)

## [0.4.1]

No user visible changes.

### Changed

- Removed some debug output that you shouldn't have seen.

## [0.4.0]

### Added

- Relative JSON Pointers are now supported. By default, when one uses
  a JSON Pointer, it is evaluated with respect to the previously
  received response body.

## [0.3.1]

## [0.3.0]

### Changed

- The arithmetic operator `+` no longer works when one argument is a
  string and the other an integer. Either both are numbers or both are
  strings.

## [0.2.0]

### Added

- The arithmetic operator `+` now takes not only two numbers (as
  before), but also two strings and a string and a non-negative
  integer. Given two strings, `+` concates them. Given a string and a
  non-negative integer *N*, it copies the string *N* times.

- A default `User-Agent` header will be added to all requests. It
  looks like this: `Riposte/0.2.0 (https://riposte.in)`. (See the
  version number there?) Previously, this header was missing (unless
  explicitly added in a Riposte script). As before, you can specify
  your own value for the `User-Agent` header to override this
  default. Currently, it is not possible to revert to the previous
  behavior where `User-Agent` was absent.

- A changelog. (Last but not least.)
